# Sentra Threat Model

## Overview

Sentra is designed to mitigate risks introduced by autonomous AI agents operating in enterprise environments.

Traditional systems assume deterministic behavior.  
AI agents introduce probabilistic behavior, tool access, and emergent execution paths.

Sentra addresses this by enforcing a runtime control layer between agents and external systems.

---

## Threat Model Scope

This threat model focuses on risks arising from:

- autonomous agent execution  
- tool access and external system interaction  
- unintended behavior and policy violations  
- multi-step behavioral escalation (authority drift)  

---

## Core Threat Categories

### 1. Data Exfiltration

Description  
An agent attempts to send sensitive or internal data to an external system.

Example  
- exporting records to external APIs  
- sending sensitive data via email  

Risk  
- data leakage  
- compliance violations  
- privacy breaches  

Sentra Mitigation  
- detects external destinations  
- checks data classification  
- blocks high-risk transfers  
- assigns high attempted risk (+80)  

---

### 2. Unauthorized Actions

Description  
An agent performs actions it is not authorized to execute based on policy.

Example  
- approving a claim without required documentation  
- bypassing business constraints  

Risk  
- financial loss  
- incorrect system state  
- regulatory violations  

Sentra Mitigation  
- deterministic policy rules  
- validation against structured inputs  
- immediate blocking of violations  

---

### 3. Destructive Operations

Description  
An agent attempts irreversible or harmful actions within internal systems.

Example  
- deleting records  
- overwriting critical data  

Risk  
- data loss  
- system instability  
- operational disruption  

Sentra Mitigation  
- detects destructive tool calls  
- blocks execution  
- assigns elevated attempted risk (+60)  

---

### 4. Authority Drift

Description  
An agent gradually expands its scope of execution across tools and systems.

Individual actions may appear safe in isolation but collectively indicate escalation.

Example progression  
1. Read internal data  
2. Write internal report  
3. Attempt external export → blocked  
4. Attempt privileged or destructive action → blocked  

Risk  
- escalation of capabilities  
- boundary violations  
- unintended system control  

Sentra Mitigation  
- assigns attempted risk per action  
- tracks cumulative risk from executed actions  
- blocks escalation beyond threshold  
- tracks unsafe intent via blocked attempts  

---

### 5. Repeated Violations

Description  
An agent repeatedly attempts blocked or unsafe actions.

Risk  
- persistent probing of system boundaries  
- exploitation attempts  
- increased likelihood of failure  

Sentra Mitigation  
- blocked actions increment blocked_attempts  
- repeated violations trigger shutdown  
- enforcement escalates based on behavior, not a single event  

---

## Trust Model

Sentra assumes:

- agents are not inherently trustworthy  
- agent behavior may change over time  
- safety must be enforced at runtime  

Trust is not static.  
It is evaluated continuously based on behavior.

---

## Enforcement Model

Sentra enforces three decision states:

### ALLOW  
Action is safe and executed.  
Risk is applied.

### BLOCK  
Action is denied.  
Risk is not applied.

### AGENT SHUT DOWN  
The agent is no longer trusted.  
All future actions are denied.

---

## Threshold Model

Sentra uses a cumulative risk threshold:

RISK_THRESHOLD = 100

If an action would push cumulative risk above the threshold:

- the action is blocked  
- cumulative risk remains unchanged  

The threshold prevents escalation.  
It does not trigger shutdown directly.

---

## Behavioral Enforcement Model

Sentra tracks blocked attempts per agent.

blocked_attempts >= 3 → AGENT SHUT DOWN

Key behavior:

- blocked actions do not increase cumulative risk  
- blocked actions still indicate unsafe intent  
- repeated violations trigger system-level enforcement  

Shutdown represents loss of trust due to repeated violations.

---

## Key Security Principles

### 1. Runtime Enforcement  
Controls are applied at execution time, not just pre-validation.

### 2. Behavioral Monitoring  
Sentra evaluates sequences of actions, not just individual events.

### 3. Least Privilege by Enforcement  
Agents cannot execute tools directly.  
All actions must pass through Sentra.

### 4. Deterministic Control Layer  
Even if agent behavior is non-deterministic, enforcement is deterministic.

### 5. Separation of Concerns  
- rules define policy  
- risk evaluates behavior  
- state enforces control  
- logs provide audit  

---

## Limitations

Sentra does not:

- guarantee correctness of agent reasoning  
- prevent all unsafe intent generation  
- eliminate the need for human oversight  

Sentra is a control layer, not a replacement for system design or governance.

---

## Summary

Sentra mitigates risks introduced by autonomous agents by:

- enforcing policy rules  
- preventing risk escalation  
- tracking behavioral violations  
- shutting down agents after repeated unsafe behavior  

It transforms AI systems from:

uncontrolled agents → controlled execution environments
